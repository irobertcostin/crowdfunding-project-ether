# CrowdfundingEther Smart Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract for a crowdfunding platform implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to contribute Ether towards a fundraising goal and provides features for claiming refunds, withdrawing funds, and managing the crowdfunding process.

## Features

- **Crowdfunding**: Contributors can send Ether to the contract to support a fundraising campaign.
- **Refunds**: If the fundraising target is not met by the end of the campaign, contributors can claim refunds for their contributions.
- **Withdrawal**: Once the fundraising target is met and the campaign ends, the owner can withdraw the collected funds.

**Contract Deployment**

Before deploying the contract, make sure to customize the following parameters in the contract code:

fundTarget: Set the fundraising target amount in Ether.
startTime and endTime: Define the start and end times of the fundraising campaign.
Usage
Contribute: Users can contribute Ether to the campaign by calling the contribute function. The contract will calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the target and refund any excess contributions.

Claim Refund: Contributors can claim refunds if the campaign end time has passed, and the target has not been reached. This is done using the claimRefund function.

Withdraw Funds: Once the campaign is successful, the owner can withdraw the collected funds using the withdrawFunds function.
